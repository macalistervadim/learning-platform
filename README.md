# Educational Project: Automatic Payment System and User Dashboard

This project was developed for educational purposes and represents a web application built using Python and various technologies to provide functionality for an automatic payment system, user dashboard, and other interesting features. In this README, we will provide an overview of the functionality and instructions for setting up and running the application.

##Key Features

- **Payment System via Stripe:** We have integrated the Stripe module to ensure secure and convenient payment for goods and services.
- **User Dashboard:** Users can register, log in to their accounts, and manage their profiles. The user dashboard includes features for managing orders, profile settings, and more.
- **Cart Using Cookie Files:** We have implemented a shopping cart for products that stores the state using cookie files, allowing users to return to their orders later.
- **Coupon System:** Users can apply coupons to receive discounts on products and services.
- **Queue System with Redis and RabbitMQ:** We use queue technologies to process background tasks and handle tasks that require extended processing time.



**P.S** - this project was created purely for practical purposes and did not intend to be used commercially
